Planning frequently asked questions
Does my tree(s) have a tree preservation order, or is it in a conservation area? 
Trees in conservation areas are protected as part of preserving the amenity value of the area, so even if the tree(s) isnâ€™t protected by a TPO, you may need to apply for consent for your proposed works.

A tree can also be protected by a TPO and be within a conservation area.

Is it a party wall? 
A party wall is when some or all of your property is connected to the boundary of land belonging to two (or more) different owners.  

You must let the different owners know if you are about to start a building project.

Owners can agree or disagree with what you propose.
